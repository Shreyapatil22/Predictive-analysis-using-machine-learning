#This project focuses on developing a machine learning classification model to predict outcomes based on a given dataset. The process begins with loading and exploring the dataset using pandas, where the structure, missing values, and data types are examined to ensure the data is ready for analysis. The dataset is then divided into features (X) and the target variable (y), with the features representing independent variables and the target variable containing classification labels. To train and evaluate the model, the dataset is split into 80% training and 20% testing sets using train_test_split().
To improve model efficiency, feature selection is performed using a Random Forest classifier, which identifies the most important variables influencing the classification. This step helps reduce unnecessary features, improving both accuracy and computational efficiency. After feature selection, the Random Forest classifier is trained on the dataset. This model is chosen for its robustness and ability to handle complex relationships within the data.
This project demonstrates the essential steps of building a classification model, from data preprocessing and feature selection to model training and evaluation. The insights gained from the model can be applied to real-world classification problems, making it a valuable tool for predictiveÂ analytics.
